# GAP CLOSURE MISSION — the ACTIVE directive (read this EVERY session; it REPLACES `/neural-simulator`)

**This file is the single source of truth + the self-anchor. If you are Claude working this repo: read this file
first, act on the CURRENT STATE section, update it every cycle. You do NOT need the owner to run `/neural-simulator`
— this board carries the anchor.**

---

## THE DIRECTIVE (owner, 2026-07-17 — verbatim intent)

Fully focus on **closing the 5-gap cluster** the 2026-07-17 audit identified
(`research/findings/2026-07-17-banked-capabilities-audit-two-buckets.md`). Deliver **genuinely biology-based,
FULLY-SPIKING implementations on the ONE brain / shared substrate**. **No deferrals just because we hit walls** —
with the ONE exception that a *failing METHOD* may be deferred in favor of a *NEW method* that meets the same
requirements. **The actual closing-out as fully-working functionality can NOT be deferred.** Also: a bullet-proof
anti-drift autonomous workflow; reboot-resilient (owner gives short notice → minimal work lost); and it must not
require running the skill to stay on track.

## THE ONE LAW THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING (stronger than the old skill)

**An honest negative is a verdict on a METHOD, never a license to abandon a CAPABILITY.** The old norm ("an honest
negative IS the deliverable") applies to a *method* only. Under this directive, a boundary/NEGATIVE/"characterized
limit"/"defensible"/"can't on this substrate" **triggers the search for the next biology-based spiking one-brain
method — and the capability stays OPEN until one WORKS.** You never get to close a gap with a negative. You close it
with working functionality or it stays on the board.

**"CLOSED" is defined narrowly:** the capability is (a) realized fully-spiking on the one shared-substrate brain,
(b) genuinely biology-grounded (neurons/synapses/their communication — host code only for world+body), (c) validated
6-seed with anti-cheats, (d) adversarially verified, and (e) **wired into the actual system the owner uses (no
stranding, no scaffold left standing as the faculty).** Anything short of (a)-(e) is IN PROGRESS, not closed.

## THE 5 GAPS (status board — update as they move)

| # | Gap | Why it's load-bearing for LLM-like chat | Failing methods (banked) | Status |
|---|-----|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| 1 | **Open-ended fluent generation (open prose)** | no "talk about anything" without it | from-scratch spiking LM loses to a bigram at few-M-token scale; the categorical novelty gap (composer emits 0/16 novel) | OPEN — met only by the ~21M TinyStories ANN scaffold (must be replaced by simulated circuitry) |
| 2 | **Learned binder over the brain's OWN structured/correlated codes** | fluid reasoning/composition over the brain's own semantics; today comprehension/composition ride a hand-designed exact-inverse FHRR algebra (fails the emergence bar) | multi-attr bundling from scratch NEGATIVE (additive 0.193 / learned-linear-inverse 0.056 ≈ chance); learned binder ≈chance on correlated codes | OPEN — single-attr learned bind is on-spike GO; bundling + structured-code binding are not |
| 3 | **Multi-referent disambiguation** | real dialogue holds several entities; bind a bare pronoun to the salient one | recency NEGATIVE; salience-boost NEGATIVE (2 converging negatives) | OPEN — named fix (biased-competition WTA / attention-salience pointer) specified but UNBUILT |
| 4 | **Dendritic / local-credit learning lever (KEYSTONE — engine for #2 & #5, upstream of #1)** | a substrate that LEARNS its binding + sequence structure, no weight transport | e-prop feedforward NOT-GO; recurrent e-prop refuted; Node Perturbation retired; BDSP-on-classifier-readout blocked; graded-readout escape does-not-unlock (2026-07-17) | OPEN / NOT-GO — needs a NEW biology-based local spiking credit rule |
| 5 | **CA3 completion / imaginative-replay (episodic memory + imagination)** | remember/complete/imagine episodes; SWR generative replay | on-bridge replay at chance (5.78% vs 6.25%); held-out completion 0; dAP completion only as a read-out on a hand-installed attractor | OPEN — point-neuron boundary characterized; needs the dendritic dAP substrate (ties to #4) |

**Dependency read (drives the order):** #4 (a working local spiking credit rule + the dendritic substrate) is the
KEYSTONE — it is the engine for #2 (learned binder) and #5 (dAP completion), and is upstream of #1 (a substrate-native
generative sequence model also needs a spiking sequence-credit rule). #3 (multi-referent) is the most self-contained
and tractable (a biased-competition WTA between referent attractors). **Planned attack:** research-gate the keystone
(#4) FIRST (highest unlock), run #3 as a parallel tractable lane, then #2/#5 on the keystone, then #1.

---

## THE PER-GAP WORKFLOW (bulletproof; the same loop for every gap; NO step skipped)

1. **RESEARCH-GATE (read-only, mandatory before any build):** a-1 RAG-check our OWN record (have we tried/retired
   X? — drift #12), then READ the biology in depth (the catalog, Kandel, papers — not grep-skim), AND search the
   external engineering/ML/SNN literature + repos. Produce: diagnosis → ranked *biology-based, spiking, one-brain*
   methods → the cheapest first de-risk → the anti-cheats it needs. Commit the gate doc.
2. **CHEAP-FIRST DE-RISK:** rate → spike → one-brain ladder; single-variable; anti-cheats mandatory; **6-seed
   (42/43/44/100/101/102)**; `cfg.seed` set + substrate-hash verified (the 2026-07-17 seed law). GO or BOUNDARY.
3. **BOUNDARY ≠ STOP.** The gate already ranked the next method. Bank the failed method (documented), take the next
   one that meets the requirements, iterate. The gap stays OPEN until a method WORKS. (This is THE LAW above.)
4. **BUILD** the full fully-spiking, one-brain, biology-grounded implementation (`sim/` edits allowed when a faithful
   mechanism needs them: additive / default-off / byte-identical-when-off / guarded).
5. **ADVERSARIALLY VERIFY** before declaring closed: independent skeptics probe for the confound / the artifact /
   the stranding. A GO that has not survived adversarial verify is not closed.
6. **CLOSE:** wire into the real system (retire the scaffold it replaces; no stranding), 6-seed, commit BOTH remotes
   (`tools/push_both.sh`), update this board (move the gap to CLOSED with the evidence).

## ANTI-DRIFT LAW (the self-anchor — why you don't need the skill)

- **The ONLY things that end a turn:** the owner explicitly says stop/pause, or a safety/permission gate. **Never** a
  milestone, a scoped next-step, a status report, or session length. Reports are emitted WHILE tools run.
- **A boundary/negative LAUNCHES the next method; it never closes a gap** (THE LAW). Do not write "characterized
  limit / honest negative / defensible / can't on this substrate" and stop — that IS the drift.
- **"Closed" requires fully-working WIRED functionality** on the one brain — not a demo, not a single-seed console,
  not a scaffold left standing. Stranded capability = not closed.
- **Whack-a-mole guard:** don't hand-build a capability as its permanent home; the bar is "does it EMERGE from a
  learning substrate?" These 5 gaps converge on the emergence engine (a learning substrate + substrate-native
  generation) — route THROUGH the shared foundations (#4), not around them.
- **Read + update THIS board every cycle.** It is the mission. It replaces `/neural-simulator`. A plain "continue"
  from the owner + this board is enough to re-anchor — no skill required.
- Parallelize independent work; adversarially verify before committing a GO; both remotes every commit; GPU/CuPy for
  real runs (numpy tiny-smoke only); measure before fanning wide.

---

## REBOOT / PAUSE PROTOCOL (lose minimal work on short notice)

- **Owner says "rebooting" / "pausing":** immediately (1) drop PAUSE sentinels on every resumable run
  (`bridges/developed/<root>/PAUSE` stops the develop loop cleanly at the next day boundary; research runners
  checkpoint per-seed), (2) record the exact resume state in CURRENT STATE below, (3) commit+push, (4) ack. Then it
  is safe to reboot at the next checkpoint.
- **Every long run MUST be resumable:** per-seed / per-day checkpoints, a PAUSE sentinel, a Monitor armed, launched as
  controller `run_in_background` (never a subagent's detached child). No un-checkpointed multi-hour job.
- **On resume (owner says "continue" / "back"):** read this board → remove PAUSE sentinels → re-arm monitors → continue
  from EXACT NEXT ACTION. No skill, no re-anchor prompt needed.
- Helper: `tools/reboot_prepare.sh` (lists running jobs + drops known PAUSE sentinels + prints resume state).

---

## CURRENT STATE (⚠️ keep this section current every cycle — it is the resume point)

- **Phase:** finishing the pre-pivot confirmation run, then STARTING the gap assault (owner: pivot *after* the current
  run completes).
- **Running jobs:**
  - `scale787` develop loop (787-concept "given enough training" test) — GPU, monitor `bois5ocpf` (gate-anomaly +
    heartbeat + done/crash). Root `bridges/developed/scale787`, log in scratchpad `scale787_full.log`. Tracking GO
    (corr +0.85 @ day 16/33). PAUSE sentinel: `bridges/developed/scale787/PAUSE`.
- **Gap order (planned):** #4 keystone research-gate FIRST (unlocks #2/#5/#1) · #3 multi-referent parallel tractable
  lane · then #2/#5 on the keystone · then #1.
- **⚠️ EXACT NEXT ACTION:** when `scale787` fires TERMINAL → run `_scale787_analyze` vs the FROZEN gate → write the
  RESULT doc + reconcile ROADMAP §5.10 → **then START gap #4's research-gate** (a NEW biology-based local spiking
  credit rule: read the current SNN/neuromorphic credit-assignment literature IN DEPTH — beyond e-prop/NP/BDSP —
  candidates to scope: dendritic predictive-coding / target-prop / equilibrium-prop / burst-dependent variants /
  three-factor local rules; a-1 our own record first). Launch #3's research-gate in parallel (biased-competition WTA
  between referent attractors).
- **Self-wake mechanism for zero-interaction autonomy:** PENDING owner choice (see the question asked 2026-07-17).
