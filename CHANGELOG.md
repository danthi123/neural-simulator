# Changelog

All notable changes to the GPU-Accelerated Neural Network Simulator will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **System Logs Panel** - Comprehensive log viewing and management
  - Real-time display of all console output within the GUI
  - Auto-scroll functionality using DearPyGUI's `tracked` parameter
  - Search functionality with previous/next navigation through matches
  - Export logs to timestamped text files
  - Clear logs functionality
  - Thread-safe `LogCapture` class for zero-overhead console mirroring
  
- **Performance Test Controls**
  - Stop button for halting running benchmarks and auto-tuning mid-execution
  - Proper state tracking to preserve existing result files
  - Informative logging showing which test type was stopped
  - Located above "Reload Auto-Tuned Overrides" button in GUI

### Changed
- **VRAM Utilization for Initialization** - Increased chunking from 40% to 70% of free VRAM
  - ~2x faster initialization for networks with 50K+ neurons
  - Example: With 18GB free VRAM, now uses 12.6GB instead of 7.2GB for chunking
  - Maintains 30% safety margin for stability
  
- **GUI Layout Improvements**
  - Auto-tuning button now stretches to fill available width (width=-80)
  - Better space utilization when window is resized wider
  - "Quick" checkbox properly positioned at right edge

### Fixed
- Auto-scroll in System Logs now works correctly using DPG best practices
  - Replaced manual scroll manipulation with `tracked=True` and `track_offset=1.0`
  - Dynamic height adjustment based on text size for proper scrolling
  - Toggle auto-scroll on/off via checkbox callback
  
- Performance test stop functionality prevents corrupted result files
  - Benchmark and auto-tuning only save results at completion
  - Stopping mid-run preserves any previously existing result files

### Technical Details
- Log capture uses thread-safe deque with 5000-line rolling buffer
- System logs display widget uses `child_window` with `input_text` for proper scrolling
- Auto-scroll implementation follows official DearPyGUI documentation patterns
- Stop flags (`performance_test_stop_flag`, `performance_test_running_type`) properly managed in try/finally blocks
