# Local-LLM runbook v4 (2026-09-30; Hermes on the server; covers about 2026-10-01 to 2026-10-14)

**For** Hermes Agent (official image, `~/apps/hermes` on homelab-server), default profile, driving from
`/home/dant123/Projects/neural-simulator` (S, canonical home since 2026-09-30 —
`docs/plans/2026-09-30-home-to-server-MIGRATION.md`) via its local terminal backend; it talks to the local model
(Qwen3.8-27B, llama-swap `qwen38-27b-iq4nl-mtp-128k-q4`) served from the workstation at `http://192.168.0.68:8080/v1`.
The repo-driven `tools/local_llm/llm.sh claude` session is retired; the 2026-10-06 date in
`docs/plans/2026-09-29-local-model-transition-PLAN.md` is superseded by this move. Claude Code inspects occasionally
from the workstation checkout `/home/dant123/Projects/sim` (W, now a follower + compute node). One driver at a
time: if the owner says a Claude session is driving, run only `bash tools/status.sh`. Read this whole file at the
start of every session; after a compaction read only sections 2-3, your task in section 4 and `tail -n 25` of its
WORKLOG. Each task links a packet HANDOFF: read only the section you execute. The HANDOFF governs its commands and
tables; this runbook governs order, permissions, `max_age_h`, verdicts, NEEDS-CLAUDE and where results go.
Set in every Bash call that uses them: `P=/home/dant123/Projects/neural-simulator; PY=$P/.venv/bin/python;
WT=$P/.claude/worktrees`. **Caveat (2026-09-30):** the packet worktrees section 4 names under `$WT` were built
before today's move and were deliberately left on the workstation, not copied to S (migration plan prep item 7) —
read an existing `$WT/<packet>` path at `/home/dant123/Projects/sim/.claude/worktrees/<packet>` until it is
recreated on S; committed files under `$P/research/findings/raw/...` are the same on both checkouts once
`sim-sync.timer` has run. "#n" = the HANDOFF's NEEDS-CLAUDE item n.

## 1. Every session

1. `bash tools/status.sh` (its READY rows `b2b_base`, `arcc_awake_completion` are stale: scored 09-29).
2. Packet status (`running>0` = still running):
   ```bash
   cd /home/dant123/Projects/neural-simulator && bash -c 'for k in _long_delay_credit_bg/sweep _long_delay_credit_bg/gate _iw2/identity iw2-R- iw2-flip- _sleep_transitive_inference/parts _host_share/gate _stage1_exit/gate _stage1_c1_category/gate _bg_live_seam/gate _iw1/identity iw1-R- iw1-flip- b2d0929/ _stage2_exit/dev; do q=$(grep -c -- "$k" research/queue/pool.queue); h=$(grep -c -- "$k" research/queue/pool.queue.held 2>/dev/null); r=$(for n in pool41 pool42; do ssh -n -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=5 $n "pgrep -fc -- $k" 2>/dev/null; done | awk "{s+=\$1} END {print s+0}"); echo "$k queued=$q held=${h:-0} running=$r"; done'
   ```
3. Read section 6 (RULINGS) and your open lines under NEEDS CLAUDE.
4. Work the FIRST task in section 4 whose "Start" holds and that no open NEEDS CLAUDE line blocks. After every step
   append to its WORKLOG: date/time, command, result paths, anything unsure (guesses marked). While pool jobs run,
   move on; never wait idle on one task.
5. Nothing ready: section 5, else stop. Never invent work; queue only what a task names.

## 2. Hard rules

- `$P` stays on `main` (live services run from it). Packet work: the packet's worktree. Your own builds:
  `$WT/draft-<topic>` on `research/draft-<topic>`, dev seeds only (7, 1-15).
- Never: merge; `--no-verify`; a waiver file; a filler job; write a file a gate reads (`lane_builds.jsonl`, queue
  files, ledgers); delete data; touch AWS; edit `sim/`, `webapp/`, `tools/gates/`; flip a default on main; change a
  prereg, bar, arm, seed list, scorer or job line (except adding `max_age_h`). Gate seeds (42/43/44/100/101/102) run
  only through lines a HANDOFF registers. Scripted exceptions: the iw1/iw2 flip commit on the packet branch (owner
  ruling 09-29), the LDC Amendment A text, and T15's field rename and correction notes (sleep-TI ruling 2).
- DENIED to you: `git merge`, `git checkout`, `git switch`, `gpu_queue.sh add`. A step that needs one (every
  NEEDS-MERGE path, `git checkout -- .`) is a STOP: NEEDS-CLAUDE. Instead of `git checkout -- <runs.jsonl>`: never
  `git add research/findings/raw/_provenance/runs.jsonl`. Never wrap a denied command in `bash -c` or a script.
- A command that asks for permission while the owner is away (always so in a headless resume): skip it, WORKLOG it,
  continue elsewhere.
- Never run `tests/test_game_pause_resume.py` (it kills live GPU jobs). One fix round per issue; a second failure is
  a STOP. Heavy local runs: `bash tools/mem_ok.sh <gb>` first, then `bash tools/memcap.sh <gb> -- ...`.
- Context: `grep -n` first, then Read at most 120 lines; never a whole source file or HANDOFF; never re-read a file
  you are writing (append; `tail -n 20`); pipe output through `head -40` / `cut -c1-200`.

## 3. Standing operations

**Pool (dispatch runs on S).** `sim-pool-dispatch.service` (host unit, user `sim`, not a user unit) dispatches
`pool.queue` from S to pool41/pool42; the queue files are the same `research/queue/pool.queue*` commands below, just
under S's `$P`. Every line you add carries `max_age_h=N` in its `--checked` reason (N = expected wait in hours, at most
240; without it the dispatcher skips the line after 12 h). If a HANDOFF line lacks it, append ` max_age_h=168`,
nothing else. The dispatcher is FIRST-FIT in file order: a node (15 GB, 2 reserved) takes the first fresh line whose
`mem_gb` fits, so 2 GB lines slip past 7-11 GB ones; heavy lines run one per node. An expired line stays in
`pool.queue` but never runs: when a packet's unrun lines are within 24 h of expiry (`bash tools/pool_queue.sh list`
shows ages), NEEDS-CLAUDE "[<task>] <n> lines expire <date>". Never re-add queued, held or dead lines.
**Pool canary (2026-09-30).** `pool_queue.sh add` refuses a gate-seed line until a gate-seed line of the same runner at
the same revision has passed on a pool node (`bash tools/pool_canary.sh list`; every requeue_*.tsv pin already has
one). A refusal naming the pool canary is a STOP: NEEDS-CLAUDE "[<task>] needs a pool canary at <sha>".
**Re-queue missing shards ONCE** (only when the task says; section 1 must show queued=0 running=0 for the key; the
block stops if any line at the file's revision is still queued or held, and re-adds only shards whose `--out` is absent):
```bash
cd /home/dant123/Projects/neural-simulator && F=<requeue file> bash -c 's=$(head -1 "$F" | grep -oE "revisions/[0-9a-f]{9}"); n=$(cat research/queue/pool.queue research/queue/pool.queue.held 2>/dev/null | grep -c "$s"); [ "$n" = 0 ] || { echo "STOP: $n lines at $s queued/held"; exit 1; }; m=0; while IFS=$'"'"'\t'"'"' read -r cmd why; do out=${cmd##*--out }; [ -f "$out" ] && continue; m=$((m+1)); bash tools/pool_queue.sh add "$cmd" --checked "$why" || echo "ADD-FAILED: $out"; done < "$F"; echo "re-queued $m"'
```

**GPU (runs on W via `gpu_remote.sh`).** The GPU queue and the local-llm server (llama-swap) live on the workstation
(W); from here queue a job with `bash tools/gpu_remote.sh add 'cd <clean committed checkout> && ...'` (gate seeds
also `--prereg <committed path>`) — it pushes your committed revision to W as `refs/server-jobs/<sha>`, builds a
sparse per-job worktree there and execs that worktree's own `gpu_add.sh`; you never `ssh` by hand. Status: `bash
tools/gpu_remote.sh status`; log: `bash tools/gpu_remote.sh log [N]`. Your queued jobs wait while your model is
up (it shares the 3090), so hand the card over at the END of the run that queued them: commit, WORKLOG "yielding
for <jobs>; resume at <task/step>", then `bash tools/gpu_remote.sh yield --max-hours N` (1-12; the jobs' expected
hours plus margin) as your last command (the model stops ~45 s later). The queue then runs the jobs; when it
drains, or N hours pass, W restarts llama-swap with the model unloaded. Your `sim-driver` wake gate starts
the next run within ~5 min of llama-swap answering, with "Woken: the workstation model server just came back" at
the top of the prompt. If the owner games mid-window, the window pauses and gets the time back. Results come back
through `sim-sync.timer`'s 15-min pull (`POOL_NODES=workstation bash tools/pool_sync.sh`), not directly from this
session: if a job's `--out` is not under `research/findings/raw/...` yet, do another task and harvest next run
rather than polling W.
`tools/local_llm/gpu_add.sh` / `llm.sh yield` run directly only when actually on W (e.g. Claude inspecting there).
**Model unreachable.** When the owner is gaming on W, `game on` stops llama-swap (and pauses W's GPU queue); the
wake gate then skips runs until `game off` restarts it (or resumes your GPU window). If a call still fails
mid-run with a connection error: do not retry in a loop; WORKLOG "model unreachable" and end the run. The same applies if
llama-swap is down for another reason (check `bash tools/gpu_remote.sh status`'s remote log, or ask Claude to check
`journalctl --user -u local-llm` on W). A cloud `fallback_model` can be added to Hermes's config for this case but is
not set up yet.

**Commits.** Pathspec only (never `-A` or `.`); `git diff --cached --name-only` lists only what you meant. Blocked
only by `compute_idle_persistent` / `lane_starvation`: retry every 30 min (max 6), then commit the Markdown part
(exempt) and NEEDS-CLAUDE; any other gate: STOP, NEEDS-CLAUDE with its message. Packet/draft branches stay on S
(RULING `push-credential`): never push them; wherever a task says "push", commit on the branch and name
`<branch> @ <sha>` in your RESULT line. On `main` commit ONLY this file: `git add
research/coordination/LOCAL_LLM_RUNBOOK.md` (the checkout has unrelated uncommitted files: the staged list must be
exactly this file), `git commit -m "runbook: <what>"` — then STOP: do not run `push_both.sh main` yourself.
`sim-sync.timer` (host unit on S, user `sim`, every 15 min) publishes `main` to both remotes via `sim-publish`;
do not check the remotes (RULING `private-repos`): a failed publish fails the unit, which alerts the owner.

**Verdict rule.** Every GO/NO-GO/PASS/FAIL you write is PROVISIONAL until Claude inspects it or records a matching
re-derivation with the registered scorer. Keep the HANDOFF's finding template; under the H1 add `**PROVISIONAL**:
written by the local model from the registered scorer's output; not yet inspected by Claude.`, and never remove it.
Numbers only from the scorer's output; words only the HANDOFF's fixed sentences.

**Results.** Per scored packet: the finding + raw files + scorer output committed and pushed on the packet branch;
the HANDOFF's board line in the WORKLOG and as a RESULT line under NEEDS CLAUDE. Where a HANDOFF says to edit
`GAP_CLOSURE_MISSION.md` or Vikunja, write the RESULT line instead (Claude syncs both).

**Units.** On S (host units, user `sim`): `systemctl status sim-pool-dispatch.service sim-sync.timer`; logs via
`journalctl -u sim-pool-dispatch` / `-u sim-sync`. You are not `sim` and cannot restart them (never `sudo`): a failed
or stopped unit is NEEDS-CLAUDE "[units] <unit> <state>". W's own `pool-dispatch`/`pool-sync` user units were
disabled at cutover and stay off; `memcap.sh` does not run inside Hermes's container (heavy local work: route to the
pool instead, per CLAUDE.md non-negotiable 10).
**Inspection.** When the owner says Claude will inspect, and after a session that wrote a RESULT: `mkdir -p _scratch
&& $PY tools/inspection_digest.py > _scratch/inspection_digest.md`, check your NEEDS CLAUDE lines appear in its
section 3, give the owner the path. Never `--mark` (Claude's).

## 4. Tasks, in expected landing order

At writing (09-30 16:55) Claude was re-queueing the lines held at 14:00 (`research/queue/pool.queue.held`), in
this order: LDC tail, iw2 D/R, host-share, BG seam, sleep-TI, Stage-1 (iw1, B2d, C1 expected next). Lines pinned to
`59edf3255`, `4f6d9d7fb` or `bb6705de6` are DEAD (worker gate-seed bug; replaced by
`research/queue/requeue_*_{f7f2bd169,c238ff325,6c2cb1362}.tsv`). The pool stays full to about 10-12.

**T0. Queue check** (every session). A key already queued at writing (not `.../gate` of LDC, not `-flip-`) that
shows queued=0 running=0 before its task's Start count: NEEDS-CLAUDE "[pool-hold] <keys>" once. Never move lines
between queue files.

**T1. Long-delay credit sweep -> Amendment A -> gate.** `$WT/long-delay-credit-spiking/docs/drafts/long-delay-credit/HANDOFF.md`
steps 4-6; WORKLOG `docs/drafts/long-delay-credit/SPIKING-WORKLOG.md`. Start:
`ls $P/research/findings/raw/_long_delay_credit_bg/sweep/ | grep -v prov | grep -c json` = 243, key queued/running 0.
First: step 4's `cp -r` + instrument command (dev seeds: no verdict). rc=0: step 5; a `chosen` other than `base`
needs a CreditParams edit that asks permission (refused or owner away: NEEDS-CLAUDE "[ldc-amendA] <tag>", stop).
Then step 3, and step 6 with ` max_age_h=168` after `mem_gb=2`. Stop: rc=2 (#4), a crash twice (#5), a gate (#2).

**T2. Integration wave 2, D/S/R.** `$WT/integration-wave2/research/packets/integration-wave2/HANDOFF.md` sections 5-8
(P=`573a9438f`); WORKLOG `research/packets/integration-wave2/WORKLOG.md` (create). Start:
`ls $P/research/findings/raw/_iw2/identity/573a943/*.json | grep -vc prov` = 5 and
`ls $P/research/findings/raw/_load_bearing/_shards/iw2-R-*-573a943/s*/*/lb.json | wc -l` = 36. First: section 5's D0
and D_p lines; its R lines only after RULING `iw2-R9`. Then the table and section 6 (flip commit), with
`neural-selfid` in FLIP only after RULING `iw2-selfid`. Write: `copy_results.sh`, verdicts, PROVISIONAL NO-GO drafts
the tables name, RESULT. Waves: T11.

**T3. Sleep transitive inference.** `$WT/sleep-transitive-inference/drafts/HANDOFF.md` steps 7-8 (1-6 done, gate at
`bfde9a195`). It is UNTRACKED: first `cd $WT/sleep-transitive-inference && git add drafts/HANDOFF.md && git commit
-m "docs(sleep-ti): execution packet"`, push. WORKLOG `WORKLOG-sleep-transitive-inference.md`. Start:
`ls $P/research/findings/raw/_sleep_transitive_inference/parts/seed*_*.json | wc -l` = 30. First: step 7 from `$P`, then
`mkdir -p $WT/sleep-transitive-inference/research/findings/raw/_sleep_transitive_inference && cp -a $P/research/findings/raw/_sleep_transitive_inference/. $WT/sleep-transitive-inference/research/findings/raw/_sleep_transitive_inference/`,
the step-8 finding on the branch, commit, push. Predicted STI NO-GO (STI7). Every outcome hands back (#8; U1/U2/U3/U7: #7).

**T4. Host-share baselines.** `$WT/host-share-baselines/docs/drafts/host-share-baselines/HANDOFF.md` sections 7-11
(GATE `f7f2bd169`); WORKLOG `docs/drafts/host-share-baselines/WORKLOG.md`. Start: section 7's count = 108; stalled
12 h below it: re-queue ONCE (section 3 block, run for `F=research/queue/requeue_host_share_f7f2bd169.tsv` and for
`F=research/queue/requeue_host_share_f7f2bd169_dispatched_failed.tsv`; never `/tmp` or `59edf3255` lines). First: section 8. Write: finding + section-9
sentences, RESULT; BASELINE-VALID also #8.

**T5. BG live-seam retirement.** `$WT/selection-seam-need-reversal/docs/drafts/selection-seam/HANDOFF.md` steps 6-8
(gate `0bc62cc31`); WORKLOG `docs/drafts/selection-seam/WORKLOG.md`. Start:
`ls $P/research/findings/raw/_bg_live_seam/gate/s*/*.json | grep -vc prov` = 42. First (results land in `$P`):
`mkdir -p $WT/selection-seam-need-reversal/research/findings/raw/_bg_live_seam/gate && cp -a $P/research/findings/raw/_bg_live_seam/gate/. $WT/selection-seam-need-reversal/research/findings/raw/_bg_live_seam/gate/`, then step 6's score in the worktree. Missing seeds: step 5's line once, `SHA=0bc62cc318278839a77293358a6fa9ad9e36a516`,
` max_age_h=72` appended. Write: step 8 (today's date), RESULT; not GO: #5.

**T6. Stage-1 exit gate.** `$WT/stage1-exit/docs/drafts/stage1-exit/HANDOFF.md` sections 6-10 (GATE `c238ff325`);
WORKLOG `docs/drafts/stage1-exit/WORKLOG.md`. Start: section 6's count = 204; stalled 6 h below it: re-queue ONCE
with `F=research/queue/requeue_stage1_exit_gate_c238ff325.tsv` (never `stage1_exit_gate_jobs.tsv`). First: section 7.
Write: finding + section-8 sentences, RESULT; any PASS: #7. Exit due 10-24: under 204 on 10-17: NEEDS-CLAUDE
"[stage1-window] <n>/204".

**T7. Stage-1 C1, category inheritance.** `$WT/stage1-c1-category/research/packets/stage1-c1-category/HANDOFF.md`
sections 4-8 (GATE `6c2cb1362`; never steps 1-3, its own re-queue block); WORKLOG
`research/packets/stage1-c1-category/WORKLOG.md`. Start: section 4's count = 54. First: section 5. Write: finding,
section-6 sentences, RESULT. Nothing landed by 10-12: #10.

**T8. Integration wave 1, D/R.** `$WT/integration-wave1/research/packets/integration-wave1/HANDOFF.md` sections 5-8
(P=`049d4bb0b`); WORKLOG `research/packets/integration-wave1/WORKLOG.md` (create). Start:
`ls $P/research/findings/raw/_iw1/identity/049d4bb/*.json | grep -vc prov` = 5 and
`ls $P/research/findings/raw/_load_bearing/_shards/iw1-R-*-049d4bb/s*/*/lb.json | wc -l` = 18. First: section 5,
then the table and section 6; section 7 only after RULING `iw1-stepB`. Write: as T2.

**T9. B2d stub arm.** `$WT/b2d-mouth-renderer/research/packets/b2d-mouth-renderer/HANDOFF.md` sections 4-10
(P=`5818dc629`); WORKLOG `research/packets/b2d-mouth-renderer/WORKLOG.md` (create). EVERY session: section 4's
"Every later session" line + ledger commit; section 5's check (mouth lines queued by Claude: yield
`--max-hours 12`). Score (sections 7-9) when 258 stub cells have landed and the mouth arm has landed or RULING
`b2d-mouth` retires it. Write: section 10, RESULT, #2.

**T10. Long-delay credit gate.** T1's HANDOFF step 7 + outcome table. Start: 150 files in
`$P/research/findings/raw/_long_delay_credit_bg/gate/`. Write: failing gates, `mechanisms`, `signatures` in the
WORKLOG, the data commit, RESULT; the finding prose is Claude's (#7-#9).

**T11. Waves B/F (iw2, then iw1).** Each HANDOFF's section 7: 43 flip lines when fewer than 10 `iw2-flip`
(`iw1-flip`) lines are queued; log `waves.tsv`; score; decision table. Merging is Claude's (#1).

**While waiting (no pool; in order):**

**T12. Seam-map amendment.** `$WT/draft-seam-map`. Start: `grep -c "Amendment 2026-09-29"
research/findings/2026-09-27-tone-bg-nchannel-tonic-firing-wall.md` = 0. Append the quoted block of T5's HANDOFF
("Separate staged work", second bullet) without the leading `> `; Markdown commit; push `research/draft-seam-map`.

**T13. Conductance-overshoot guard.** `$WT/conductance-overshoot-guard` (5 files staged 09-29, never committed).
`SIM_BACKEND=numpy $PY -m pytest -q tests/test_bounded_conductance_integration.py` (4 passed); `git commit -m
"feat(engine): enable_bounded_conductance_integration (default off), bounded conductance currents, off path
byte-identical"`; push; `bash tools/local_llm/gpu_add.sh 'cd /home/dant123/Projects/sim/.claude/worktrees/conductance-overshoot-guard && SIM_BACKEND=cupy /home/dant123/Projects/sim/.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_bounded_conductance_integration.py'`;
run it in your next yield; rc from `gpu_queue.log` into its WORKLOG; INFO line.

**T14. Stage-2 dev arms.** When 8 new files land in `$P/research/findings/raw/_stage2_exit/dev/s7/` (or their
`max_age_h=24` lines expire): INFO line. The gate is queued 11-03..11-10, never before 11-01
(`$WT/stage2-exit-gate/docs/drafts/stage2-exit/HANDOFF.md` section 1).

**T15. Ecker CA3 OU-noise field** (sleep-TI ruling 2). Nine `research/runners/_gap5_*` set `cfg.ou_noise_sigma_pa`,
which the engine never reads (it reads `ou_std_current_pA`, default 100 pA in `sim/config.py`): runs reported at
40 pA ran at 100. `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/draft-ecker-ou-field -b research/draft-ecker-ou-field main`;
`grep -n "ou_noise_sigma_pa\|ou_std_current_pA" research/runners/*.py`. A runner setting only the phantom field:
rename it to `ou_std_current_pA` (same value, a comment naming T15), `$PY -m py_compile` it. One setting both
(`_gap5_onebrain_capstone.py`): no edit, NEEDS-CLAUDE. Per runner `grep -ln "<stem>" research/findings/*.md`; table
(finding, runner, stated value, value run) in `docs/drafts/ecker-ou-field/AFFECTED.md`; append to each affected
finding a dated `Correction (PROVISIONAL, local model)` paragraph with both values, nothing re-interpreted. Commit,
push, no runs. Then NEEDS-CLAUDE "[ecker-ou] FAILURE_LOG row + gate (task_8f9171ae)".

**T16. chat-fact-fixes.** `$WT/chat-fact-fixes/research/packets/chat-fact-fixes/HANDOFF.md`: nothing unless RULING
`cff-reverify` (then its section 2).

## 5. Idle (only when no task can move)

Test triage on `research/draft-test-triage` (`docs/drafts/test-triage/`): `bash tools/mem_ok.sh 12 && bash
tools/memcap.sh 12 -- env SIM_NO_PROVENANCE=1 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES= .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -p
no:cacheprovider --continue-on-collection-errors --ignore=tests/test_game_pause_resume.py
--junitxml=_scratch/suite.xml -rfE tests`; group failures by first error line (GPU hidden = ENVIRONMENT). No fixes.

## 6. RULINGS (Claude writes `- <KEY>: <ruling> (<date>)`; you follow it)

- push-credential: by design there is no push credential on S and `sim-publish` publishes `main` only. Packet and
  draft branches live in this checkout (ZFS-snapshotted and backed up); do not run `push_both.sh`. After committing on a
  branch, name `<branch> @ <sha>` in the RESULT line; Claude reviews and merges on S. GPU jobs need no push
  (`gpu_remote.sh` sends the revision to W itself). (2026-09-30)
- private-repos: GitHub and Gitea are private and S has no credential, so never `git fetch`, `pull` or `ls-remote` a
  remote from here. Every pushed `research/*` branch was imported as `origin/research/<name>` (2026-09-30); later
  branches are created here. Start a packet/draft worktree from `origin/research/<name>` or the local branch.
  (2026-09-30)
- permissions: the seeded item was about Claude Code's workstation allow list, which Hermes does not use. Under
  Hermes, scheduled runs may use ssh, rsync, `source`, file edits, `bash -c`/`-lc`, pytest and git without a
  prompt; `python -c`/`-e` one-liners are still refused: write the snippet to `_scratch/<name>.py` and run that.
