# gap#1 Rung 1a — the WKV/linear-attention LEARNED key–value recurrence 6-SEED GO at ceiling-valid scale: it BEATS the fair interpolated trigram at deep context (the exact bar every fading reservoir FAILED), removing the documented non-fading-store wall. The mission-primary open-generation lever, validated.

**2026-07-19.** Per the gap#1 research gate (`2026-07-19-gap1-open-generation-research-gate-WKV-learned-KV-recurrence-is-the-next-build`),
built + ran the WKV de-risk (`research/runners/_emerge_wkv_lm_derisk.py`). **6/6 GO at the ceiling-valid scale** (TinyStories,
V=2000, d_model=256, 80K train sentences, ~9 min total on GPU).

## RESULT (6-seed 42/43/44/100/101/102, DEEP context d10-99)
| metric | value (range) | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **WKV beats FAIR interpolated trigram** | **+0.62 to +0.73 nats** | the exact control that KILLED every reservoir lever (`2026-07-15`: fading memory LOST to it at every depth) — WKV BEATS it, 6/6 |
| margin GROWS with depth | d2 +0.23 → d6-9 +0.67 | the transformer/LSTM long-range SIGNATURE (a bigram/fixed-window can't) |
| perm-collapse (shuffle prefix order) | +4.2 to +4.4 | the deep-context advantage collapses → genuine long-range ORDER use, not a context bag |
| memoryless-collapse (recurrence off) | **+1.06 to +1.16** | the LEARNED recurrence carries >1 nat of deep-context info beyond the current token (grows with depth) — isolates the RECURRENCE from the embedding |

⇒ the WKV op (an O(N) recurrent gated leaky K/V integrator with learned K,V,receptance,decay) is a **content-selective
NON-FADING learned-write store** — the "deepest unbuilt frontier" the arc's own synthesis named, which every reservoir/
echo-state/e-prop/ALIF lever lacked. This is the at-scale confirmation of the decision's core bet (SpikeGPT's 45M-param
spiking existence proof at this project's scale).

## HONEST SCOPE (Rung 1a is foundational, NOT the full gap#1 close — the ladder ahead)
- **Input = a LEARNED EMBEDDING** (not yet the emergent stream-cortex pooler codes = Rung 1b, the emergence-bar priority;
  the memoryless-collapse already proves the deep-context signal is the RECURRENCE, not the embedding — but the input
  must become emergent to clear the bar).
- **Trained by BPTT** (a TRACKED shortcut to establish the MECHANISM first; Rung 3 biologizes the rule — e-prop/BDSP on
  the fixed-form recurrence, the R3-REFRAME 78%-closed input-rep lever).
- **Rate-level** (not yet spiking = Rung 2: port the fixed-form WKV/SSM recurrence onto a spiking `BrainRegion`; SpikeGPT
  confirms faithful; SNN membrane leak IS the SSM state update).
- **Within-sentence deep context** (≤16 tokens, apples-to-apples with the reservoir arc). Cross-sentence / open
  multi-clause prose is the further R4 reach (the WKV recurrence CAN carry cross-sentence context — a follow-on test).
- **The gap#1↔gap#4 convergence:** Rung 1b feeds the WKV read from the UNSUPERVISED stream cortex (the gap#4-pivot
  deep-representation engine) — this is where the two gaps meet.

## STATUS + NEXT (per the decision's ladder + the emergence bar)
- **DONE (Rung 1a, 6-seed GO):** the WKV MECHANISM removes the non-fading-store wall at the rate level.
- **NEXT (in flight): de-risk the emergent-input (Rung 1b) regime cheaply BEFORE its expensive prerequisite** — a
  FROZEN-embedding variant (freeze the input at random init; only WKV+head learn) tests whether the mechanism works with
  a FIXED (non-LM-learned) input = the Rung 1b regime (the pooler codes are learned by the unsupervised cortex, frozen for
  the LM). GO → Rung 1b's TinyStories stream-cortex develop is worth building; the mechanism doesn't depend on a learned
  embedding.
- **THEN:** Rung 1b (develop stream-cortex codes over the TinyStories vocab → feed as WKV input), Rung 2 (spiking port),
  Rung 3 (biologize the rule). PARALLEL engineering: the 21M spiking-forward deploy (ledgered scaffold, milestone-met NOT
  closed). NO `sim/` edit anywhere in Rung 1a. Runner: `_emerge_wkv_lm_derisk.py`.
